### About Me
As a solutions engineer with expertise in AI implementation and helpdesk automation, I have a solid IT foundation complemented by my academic background. I am particularly drawn to penetration testing and web application security, while also dedicating time outside of work hours to developing machine learning models and exploring AI-driven software development.
